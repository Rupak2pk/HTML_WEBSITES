			<h3>Setting</h3>
			<p>Pokemon Red takes place in the Kanto region, based on Japan's real Kanto
				region in Japan. This is one distinct region, as shown in later games, with 
				different geographical habitats for the 151 existing Pokémon species, along 
				with human-populated towns and cities and Routes connecting locations with
				one another. Some areas are only accessible once the player learns a special 
				ability or gains a special item. Kanto has multiple locations: Pallet Town, 
				Viridian City, Pewter City, Cerulean City, Vermillion City, Lavender Town, 
				Celadon City, Fuchsia City, Saffron City, Cinnabar Island, Seafoam Islands
				and the Indigo Plateau. Each city has a gym leader, serving as the boss and
				the Elite Four and final	rival battle occur at Indigo Plateau. 
			</p>
			<p>Areas in which the player can catch Pokémon	range from caves to the sea, 
				where the kinds of Pokémon available to catch varies. For example, Tentacool 
				can only be caught either through fishing or when the player is in a body of 
				water, while Zubat can only be caught in a cave.
			</p>
			<h3>Story</h3>
			<p>The player begins in their hometown of Pallet Town. After venturing alone 
				into the tall grass, the player is stopped by Professor Oak, a famous Pokémon
				researcher. Professor Oak explains to the player that wild Pokémon may be 
				living there and encountering them alone can be very dangerous. He takes the 
				player to his laboratory where the player meets Oak's grandson, a rival 
				aspiring Pokémon Trainer. The player and the rival are both instructed to select 
				a starter Pokémon for their travels out of Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Charmander.
			</p>
			<p>Oak's Grandson will always choose the Pokémon which is stronger against
				the player's starting Pokémon. He will then challenge the player to a Pokémon 
				battle with their newly obtained Pokémon and will continue to battle the player
				at certain points throughout the games.
			</p>
			<p>While visiting the region's cities, the player will encounter special 
				establishments called Gyms. Inside these buildings are Gym Leaders, 
				each of whom the player must defeat in a Pokémon battle to obtain a total 
				of eight Gym Badges. Once the badges are acquired, the player is given 
				permission to enter the Indigo League, which consists of the best 
				Pokémon trainers in the region. There the player will battle the Elite Four
				and finally the new Champion: the player's rival. Also, throughout the game,
				the player will have to battle against the forces of Team Rocket, a criminal
				organization that abuses Pokémon.[5] They devise numerous plans for stealing 
				rare Pokémon, which the player must foil.
